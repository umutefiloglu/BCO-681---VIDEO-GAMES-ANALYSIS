# BCO 681 - VIDEO GAMES ANALYSIS
- Game analysis works from BCO 681 - VIDEO GAMES ANALYSIS lesson taken from Hacettepe University
  - Lesson was taken from Professor Hakan TÜZÜN. For more information: http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~htuzun/
- These works are written in Turkish. However; if you are interested in my work and want to read, I can translate into English.
  - There are more than 30.000 words (including headers, captions etc.). Therefore, it is a huge work for me to translate all of them into English.
- My most detailed work is [Ghostbuster's Game Analysis]()
