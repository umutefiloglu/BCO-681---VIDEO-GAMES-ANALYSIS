# BCO 681 - VIDEO GAMES ANALYSIS
- Game analysis works from BCO 681 - VIDEO GAMES ANALYSIS lesson taken from Hacettepe University
  - Lesson was taken from Professor Hakan TÜZÜN. For more information: http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~htuzun/
- These works are written in Turkish. However; if you are interested in my work and want to read, I can translate into English.
  - There are more than 30.000 words (including headers, captions etc.). Therefore, it is a huge work for me to translate all of them into English.
- My most detailed work is [Ghostbuster's Game Analysis](https://github.com/umutefiloglu/BCO-681---VIDEO-GAMES-ANALYSIS/blob/master/Game%20Analysis%20PDFs/Ghostbusters%20Game%20Analysis%20(TR)%20-%20Umut%20EF%C4%B0LO%C4%9ELU.pdf)
- Known typo(s) is(are) fixed later.
